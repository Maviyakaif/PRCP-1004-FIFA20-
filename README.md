# FIFA Players Dataset Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes the FIFA players dataset using various data science techniques. It focuses on feature selection, clustering, and statistical analysis to extract meaningful insights from the data.

## 📂 Dataset Information
The dataset contains information about FIFA players, including their physical attributes, skills, and performance metrics. Key columns include:
- **Player Information**: Name, nationality, club, age, height, weight, etc.
- **Skills & Attributes**: Pace, shooting, passing, dribbling, defending, physic, etc.
- **Positioning & Role**: Preferred foot, player positions, work rate, etc.
- **Financials**: Market value, wage, release clause, contract details, etc.
- **Goalkeeping Attributes**: Diving, handling, kicking, reflexes, speed, positioning.

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Checked missing values and handled them appropriately.
- Visualized distributions of key features using histograms, box plots, and scatter plots.
- Identified highly correlated features using a heatmap.
- Analyzed categorical vs numerical data for clustering and predictions.

## 📊 Key Findings
- **Player Age Distribution**: Most players are between 20-30 years old.
- **Top Attributes for Clustering**: Overall rating, pace, dribbling, and passing are crucial in categorizing players.
- **Market Value & Wage Analysis**: Highly skilled players have exponentially higher wages and market value.
- **Positional Strengths**: Forwards have better shooting, midfielders excel in passing, and defenders have higher defending stats.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)
- **Jupyter Notebook** for analysis
- **GitHub** for version control

## 🚀 How to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository:
